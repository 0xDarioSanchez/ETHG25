# Lancer Protocol

![banner](images/banner.png "Banner")

üåê An open-source protocol for building on-top decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed for developers to create and deploy their own dApps with on-chain escrows, payments and dispute resolution systems.

## Problem
Centralized marketplace platforms charge high fees, in case of cross-border payments they can be delayed for several days and have an average cost of 6.04%. While they rely on dispute processes centralized in the same platforms.

## Solution
**Lancer Protocol** provides the foundational infrastructure for decentralized marketplaces and payment applications.
It allows developers to integrate secure escrow mechanisms, on-chain dispute resolution, and programmable payment flows directly into their dApps, without rebuilding these components from scratch. While obtaining:
- **Low Fees**: Minimal fees since we allow a revenue model based on yield through lending protocols as Aave.
- **Fast Payments**: Sellers or freelancers can withdraw instantly to their wallets, avoiding conversion or cross-border bank delays.
- **Free Payments**: Transfers through Ethereum have minimal costs even for cross-border payments.
- **Trustless Escrow**: Smart contracts lock funds, releasing only on verified conditions, reducing dispute bias.
- **Transparency**: The escrow and voting systems are open-source and immutable while all transactions are public on Etherscan.

üß≠ Overview

At its core, Lancer Protocol standardizes how digital agreements and payments are handled on-chain:

**Escrow Contracts** hold funds in PYUSD until both parties are satisfied.

**Dispute Resolution Layer** enables verifiable and transparent dispute handling, optionally powered by decentralized oracles or third-party arbitration modules.

**Modular Architecture** developers can plug in or extend modules (reputation systems, insurance, arbitration, AI agents, etc.) for their use case.

This modular approach transforms Lancer Protocol into a composable backend for trustless applications, ideal for:

Freelance & gig marketplaces
DAO bounty platforms
AI-to-AI or agentic payment flows
Peer-to-peer commerce
Web3 escrow-as-a-service infrastructure

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- Escrow Creation
A buyer or dApp creates an escrow, specifying deal conditions, seller and the amount in **PYUSD**.
Funds are locked securely in the contract until release or dispute resolution.

- Safe Payments
Payments remain in escrow until both sides approve, ensuring fairness.
Developers can build custom logic around deadlines, milestones, or deliverables.

- Dispute Handling
If a disagreement occurs, users can trigger a dispute through DisputeManager.
The protocol emits verifiable events, which can be indexed via Envio HyperIndex or settled cross-chain with Avail.

- Smart Contract Transparency (**Blockscout**)
Lancer integrates Blockscout for allowing anyone to explore contract code, transactions, and interactions directly from the Lancer frontend.

- Data Indexing (**Envio**)
All on-chain events are indexed in real-time using Envio HyperIndex, allowing instant access to user escrows, dispute status, and analytics dashboards.



## ‚úÖ Setup

### Requirements

You need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))

### Quickstart

To get started follow those steps:

1. Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Foundry. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/foundry/foundry.toml`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. If you want to deploy on a real testnet you can execute:

```
forge script script/DeploySepolia.s.sol \
  --rpc-url sepolia \
  --private-key $SEPOLIA_DEPLOYER_KEY \
  --broadcast
```

4. To start the frontend run:

```
yarn start
```

Visit the app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract going to `Lancer App` page.

5. For running smart contract test use 
   
```
yarn foundry:test
```
