# Envio Integration  

#### Real-Time Indexing for Transparent Marketplaces  

## Overview  

Envio’s **HyperIndex** plays a crucial role in Lancer, powering real-time data tracking and analytics across all marketplaces, escrows, and disputes.  

For the frontend, directly requesting data from the blockchain is slow and inefficient. But by indexing marketplace events with **Envio HyperIndex**, Lancer allows marketplace creators and users to read data instantly from an optimized indexer, making frontend visualizations faster and the overall UX significantly smoother. That transform on-chain events into instantly queryable data, enabling a fast, responsive, and data-rich experience for the end users.

Lancer’s Envio integration dynamically tracks every marketplace deployed through the Factory contract. Each new instance is automatically indexed by HyperIndex, allowing creators to instantly query deals, escrows, and disputes through a unified data layer: which means no manual setup required.

## How Envio is Integrated  

1. **Event Schema Design**  
   1.1. I defined a  schema to index key contract events such as:  
   `DealCreated`, `DealFinalized`, `DealDisputed`, `JudgeAssigned`, `VoteSubmitted`, and `ReputationUpdated`.  
   1.2. Each event is structured to minimize redundancy and ensure consistency across multiple deployed marketplaces.  

2. **Multichain Compatibility**  
   2.1. Since each marketplace is deployed via the **Lancer Factory**, HyperIndex is configured to track all instances dynamically, even from different chains.  
   2.2. This enables **cross-marketplace queries**, and despite that is not implemented yet since I'm working exclusivelly with Sepolia, it will very important in the future, after implementing new chains.  

3. **Efficient Event Handling**  
   3.1. HyperIndex continuously listens to smart contract events, reducing latency between on-chain actions and frontend updates.  
   3.2. That means far faster UI updates for deals, disputes, balances, etc; without waiting for manual refreshes or RPC polling.  

4. **Meaningful Data Querying**  
   Developers and users can query:  
   - Total PYUSD locked in escrows  
   - Number of active or completed deals  
   - User reputation history  
   - Marketplace-level analytics such as total volume, fees, and disputes resolved.  

## Why This Integration  

Lancer’s Envio integration demonstrates a **sophisticated and technically optimized** use of HyperIndex as a high-performance, multichain indexing framework:  

| **Hackathon Criteria** | **Lancer’s Value** |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| **Schema Design** | Optimized schema captures key lifecycle events for escrows, disputes, and judges. |
| **Event Handling** | Efficient real-time updates minimize latency between transactions and frontend state. |
| **Data Querying** | Rich queries power dashboards, analytics, and user insights directly from indexed on-chain data. |
| **Performance Impact** | Reading data from HyperIndex instead of RPC calls dramatically improves frontend speed and UX. |
| **Multichain Support** | Supports all marketplaces deployed via Lancer Factory, ensuring scalability and composability. |

## Summary  

**Lancer + Envio = Real-Time Transparency for Web3 Marketplaces.**  

Envio HyperIndex transforms Lancer into a live, analytics-enabled escrow ecosystem, where every transaction, reputation update, and dispute can be tracked and queried instantly, providing unmatched visibility and user experience.
