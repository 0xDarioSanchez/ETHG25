# PYUSD Integration 

### Powering Trusted Web3 Payments in Lancer

## Overview

PYUSD, serves as the core payment medium of the Lancer ecosystem, which also means of all the marketplaces later deployed. By leveraging PYUSD’s reliability, regulatory backing, and instant on-chain transferability, Lancer enables a new model for trustless, yield-generating escrow marketplaces.

In Lancer, every payment between Payers and Beneficiaries occurs in PYUSD, ensuring price stability, real-world usability, and a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized infrastructure.

Through PYUSD, Lancer demonstrates how stablecoins can unlock financial inclusion, fair work agreements, and autonomous digital marketplaces.

## How PYUSD is Integrated

1. **PYUSD as the Native Currency**

1.1. All marketplace transactions, escrows, dispute rewards, and judge incentives are denominated in PYUSD.

1.2. This guarantees predictable pricing and eliminates volatility risk for all the parts involved.

2. **On-Chain Escrow Mechanism**

2.1. When a `Payer` confirms a deal, PYUSD is transferred into a marketplace escrow contract.

2.2. Funds remain locked on-chain until deal completion or dispute resolution.

3. **Yield Optimization through Aave**

3.1. While locked, PYUSD is supplied to Aave, generating passive yield.

3.2. The yield is claimable by the marketplace creator, incentivizing ecosystem growth while funds remain safe and auditable.

4. **Automated Release & Dispute Flows**

4.1. Upon deal completion, PYUSD is released directly to the Beneficiary.

4.2. If a dispute occurs, a portion of the PYUSD balance is routed to the Lancer Protocol, funding judges and resolution rewards.

## Why This Integration

Lancer’s PYUSD integration demonstrates a **practical and scalable real-world use case for stablecoins**, enabling a fully on-chain workflow that blends **trustless payments, yield generation, and decentralized dispute resolution**.

| **Criteria** | **Lancer’s Value** |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| **Functionality** | Fully functional on-chain escrow flow using PYUSD, integrated with Aave and dispute resolution logic. |
| **Payments Applicability** | Directly addresses freelancer payment challenges: trust, stability, and cross-border accessibility using PYUSD as the universal settlement currency. |
| **Novelty** | Introduces yield-generating escrows and decentralized arbitration with PYUSD, merging DeFi and digital payments. |
| **UX** | Predictable value and instant transactions, with transparency via Blockscout and real-time data indexing through Envio. |
| **Open Source** | Entire stack is open-source and composable with other EVM protocols and primitives. |
| **Business Plan** | Lancer can evolve into a scalable Web3 marketplace protocol for digital work, e-commerce, and remittances; powered entirely by PYUSD. |


## Future Modifications

After the hackathon, the plan is to continue developing Lancer with additional functionality:

1. **Multi-token Support** — Allow users to pay with other ERC-20 tokens. If the token is not PYUSD, the system will perform an automatic swap via Uniswap or another DEX, enabling flexibility while maintaining stability and simplicity in contract logic.

2. **Fiat On/Off-Ramps** — Integrate with on-ramp and off-ramp providers (such as MoneyGram) to support fiat payments and withdrawals, simplifying the user experience.

3. **Multiple Lending Protocols** — Enable marketplace owners to choose among different DeFi protocols for yield generation, increasing flexibility and returns.

## Summary

> **Lancer + PYUSD = Trust, Transparency, and Scalable Web3 Payments.**
