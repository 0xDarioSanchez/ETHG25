# PYUSD Integration 

### Powering Trusted Web3 Payments in Lancer

## Overview

PYUSD, serves as the core payment medium of the Lancer ecosystem, which also means of all the marketplaces later deployed. By leveraging PYUSD’s reliability, regulatory backing, and instant on-chain transferability, Lancer enables a new model for trustless, yield-generating escrow marketplaces.

In Lancer, every payment between Payers and Beneficiaries occurs in PYUSD, ensuring price stability, real-world usability, and a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized infrastructure.

## How PYUSD is Integrated

1. **PYUSD as the Native Currency**

1.1. All marketplace transactions, escrows, dispute rewards, and judge incentives are denominated in PYUSD.

1.2. This guarantees predictable pricing and eliminates volatility risk for both freelancers and clients.

2. **On-Chain Escrow Mechanism**

2.1. When a Payer confirms a deal, PYUSD is transferred into a marketplace escrow contract.

2.2. Funds remain locked on-chain until deal completion or dispute resolution.

3. **Yield Optimization through Aave**

3.1. While locked, PYUSD is supplied to Aave, generating passive yield.

3.2. The yield is claimable by the marketplace creator, incentivizing ecosystem growth while funds remain safe and auditable.

4. **Automated Release & Dispute Flows**

4.1. Upon deal completion, PYUSD is released directly to the Beneficiary.

4.2. If a dispute occurs, a portion of the PYUSD balance is routed to the Lancer Protocol, funding judges and resolution rewards.
