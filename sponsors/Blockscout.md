# Blockscout Integration  
#### Transparency and Trust through Open Exploration  

## Overview  

Blockscout‚Äôs **Autoscout** allows Lancer to provide users and judges with full visibility into all on-chain actions.  
By deploying a custom Blockscout explorer through Autoscout, every contract interaction ‚Äî from escrow creation to dispute resolution ‚Äî becomes publicly verifiable and developer-accessible via API.  

Transparency is the foundation of trust in decentralized marketplaces.  
Blockscout empowers Lancer to offer **verifiable, human-readable proof** of every contract action, without relying on centralized intermediaries.  

With Autoscout, the Lancer ecosystem gains an **open-source explorer** that enhances user confidence, auditability, and developer onboarding.  

## How Blockscout is Integrated  

1. **Autoscout Deployment**  
   1.1. Using Blockscout‚Äôs self-service explorer launchpad, Lancer deployed a dedicated explorer instance connected to the testnet used during development.  
   1.2. This enables a one-click view of all transactions, addresses, and smart contract metadata.  

2. **Custom Configuration**  
   2.1. The explorer is branded for Lancer, displaying all core protocol contracts and deployed marketplace instances.  
   2.2. Each contract‚Äôs verified source code is published directly through Blockscout for public inspection.  

3. **API Integration**  
   3.1. The frontend connects to the Blockscout API to retrieve real-time transaction data and link users directly to verified on-chain actions.  
   3.2. This enhances transparency for all participants ‚Äî **Payers, Beneficiaries, and Judges**.  

4. **Developer & User Benefits**  
   4.1. Developers can debug and audit contract behavior easily through Blockscout‚Äôs verified source views.  
   4.2. Users gain confidence through **full traceability** of every escrow, payment, and dispute decision.  

## Why This Integration  

Lancer‚Äôs integration showcases Autoscout‚Äôs potential as a **fast and flexible explorer launchpad** for any EVM-based ecosystem.
